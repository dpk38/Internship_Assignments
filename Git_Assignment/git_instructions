git diff                        (working area vs local repository)
[git add -> moves the file from working area to the staging area.]
git diff --staged               (staging area vs local repository)
git diff HEAD <commit_number>   (working area vs staging)
git diff <commit_number1> <commit_number2>

git revert <commit_number>      (Adds another commit - commits contain changed set)

git log (head points to latest commit)
git log --graph

git reset <filename>    (removes file from stage)
git checkout HEAD --<filename>      (discards all changes)  

checkout - goes to specified commit | revert - changes and creates new 

--------------------------
whats staging area
merging after resolving conflict in side branch
why add newline
--------------------------

git pull origin master = git fetch origin master && git merge master origin/master

forking - creating a copy of a remote repo of a different user (similar to branching but by a different user)
cloning

upstream (similar to origin for different user) - git remote add upstream <url>

--------------------------

git stash save "<message>"
stashes current working directory with unique id and rolls back to current commit state
git stash apply <stash_id>
